# switchjdk
A directory of batch scripts to switch your JDK for Windows

## Usage

1. Download the files. 


2. Open your environmental variables. Under your system variables, create a `JAVA_MAIN` variable. This variable needs to hold the path to one of your JDKs. 

3. You should have your second JDK  installed. If that is in your user variables, copy the filepath for the second JDK version.

4. Edit the second batch script and replace the path. 

5. You can now run the batch script by their name.
