Java Developers typically work with multiple JDK versions on their computer. This repo aids Windows users to seamlessly change their JDK version via CLI

## Usage

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhivemp/switchjdk.git
   ```

   


2. Open your environmental variables. Under your system variables, create a `JAVA_HOME` variable. This variable needs to hold the path to one of your JDKs. *Note:* *This JDK version needs to be the same in your user variables as well*

3. Make sure your second JDK version is installed in the right place. *Note: It's usually in your* `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-10`

4. Change the paths of both JDK versions and rename the files accordingly

5. You can now run the batch script by their name.
